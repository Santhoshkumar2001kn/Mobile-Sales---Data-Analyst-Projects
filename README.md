Power BI (Data Modeling, DAX, Visualizations)

Problem Statements:
"The mobile sales team needs a comprehensive, interactive, and visual way to analyze mobile phone sales performance across cities, brands, and models to make informed business decisions and optimize sales strategies."


I am created a Mobile Sales Data Dashboard using Microsoft Power BI.
This dashboard provides a dynamic, interactive view of mobile sales across India â€” covering:
Total Sales, Quantity & Transactions
Sales by City, Month & Day
Brand and Model-wise Performance
Customer Ratings & Payment Method Insights

Tools & Skills Used:
Power BI (Data Modeling, DAX, Visualizations)
Interactive Reports with Filters & Slicers
Business Intelligence & Data Analysis

How the Dashboard Solves It:
Combines multiple KPIs (Total Sales, Quantity, Transactions) in one view.
Uses interactive visuals (map, bar, line, pie charts) to explore data by city, month, and day.
Enables deep dives into brand- and model-specific performance.
Tracks customer ratings to monitor satisfaction.
Analyzes payment method preferences for operational insights.
